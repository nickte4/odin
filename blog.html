    <h1>Local Dog Rescue.</h1>
    <h4>Authored by: Nick Topacio</h4>

    <h3>The Situation</h3>
    <p>
      According to locals, a tiny Shih-Tzu puppy was found trapped high up in
      the branches of a massive oak tree. A shopkeeper nearby called the local
      fire department for help.
    </p>

    <h3>The Help</h3>
    <p>
      With the help of both locals and firemen, the puppy safely made it to the
      ground where his owner, a 6 year-old, quickly comforted and embraced the
      shaken pup.
